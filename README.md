# What's for Dinner?
[Cooper Terrones](https://github.com/coopterrones) What's for Dinner? Solo Project; Mod 1

### Description:
-The 'What's for Dinner?' application allows users to generate random food dishes by selecting a dish type and generating a random dish by clicking the 'Let's Cook!' button. Users can also add a new dish by name and type that will store in the correct lists.

### Usage:
-Navigate [this website](https://coopterrones.github.io/whats-for-dinner/). Generate random dishes by selecting a dish type and clicking the "Let's Cook!" button. Add to the list of dishes by clicking the "Add Recipe" button in the header, and input the recipe type in the correct input field and recipe name in the correct input field. Save the recipe by clicking the "Add New" button. Users can generate new random dishes and watch to see if their value is available for selection, or open dev tools to examine the array type to view the dish in its correct type.

### Timeline:
-This project was completed over a 5 day period. Each iteration was completed and pushed to Github. This project was completed on time.

### Resources
-To complete our project, we used Github to manage our projects workflow, Atom as the text editor, and Zoom to video conference with peers and mentors for advice. Mentors, rocks (peers in later modules), and peers within the cohort were valuable for insights and rubber-ducking.
